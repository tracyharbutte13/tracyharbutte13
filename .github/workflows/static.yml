#import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.flex}>
      <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://movion-omega-market-sentinel.github.io/demo-repository/' }} style={styles.flex} />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({ flex: { flex: 1 } });

Replace the URL with your deployed web app URL (or use GitHub Pages if you have it set up).

Build steps:

Copy

Install Node.js and React Native CLI.

npx react-native init MyMobileApp

cd MyMobileApp

npm install react-native-webview

Replace App.js with the code above.

Run with npx react-native run-android or run-ios.

**B. Android Native Example**

MainActivity.java

WebView myWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
myWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
myWebView.loadUrl("https://movion-omega-market-sentinel.github.io/demo-repository/");

See Android WebView docs:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView

**C. iOS Native Example (Swift)**

import WebKit
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let webView = WKWebView(frame: self.view.frame)
        self.view.addSubview(webView)
        let url = URL(string: "https://movion-omega-market-sentinel.github.io/demo-repository/")!
        webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
    }
}

See Apple WebView docs:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview

2. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**

You can turn your web app into a PWA, so mobile users can "install" it to their home screen and launch it like an app.

PWA guide:
https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps

3. **No-Code/Low-Code Wrappers**

Use services like GoNative.io:
https://gonative.io/
WebViewGold:
https://www.webviewgold.com/
or Thunkable:
https://thunkable.com/
to convert your URL to a mobile app without coding.

4. **Next Steps**

Let me know: 

Do you want iOS, Android, or both?

Do you want a simple web wrapper or a full-featured native app?

Is your web app already deployed and responsive for mobile?

Would you like detailed step-by-step instructions for one of the options above?

Let me know your preferred approach, and Iâ€™ll guide you through the exact steps!

 Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy static content to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Single deploy job since we're just deploying
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
